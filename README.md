# Teaching Marketing Analytics: A Pricing Exercise for Quantitative and Substantive Marketing Skills
This repository contains the exercise, solution, and data described in Skiera and Jürgensmeier (2023): "Teaching Marketing Analytics: A Pricing Exercise for Quantitative and Substantive Marketing Skills"


# Abstract

The article describes a data-driven exercise for teaching and assessing students’ skills in marketing analytics, specifically in pricing. This exercise draws on knowledge in econometrics for analyzing data and marketing knowledge to derive managerial insights. The econometric challenge requires students to set up and implement a regression analysis to derive the demand function, detect multicollinearity, and select appropriate data visualizations. The substantive challenge requires deriving optimal pricing decisions and understanding how the parameters of the demand function impact optimal prices and the associated profit. The exercise serves as a case study for in-class discussion, an assignment, or an in-class or take-home exam to assess students’ skills. Under a liberal CC BY license and free of charge, we encourage other educators to use the exercise in their teaching. Beyond the exercise, we provide the necessary data and a sample solution using the statistical programming language R.
